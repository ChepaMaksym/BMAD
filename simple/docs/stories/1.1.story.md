# Story 1.1: Project Setup & Basic CI/CD

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to have the basic project structure for UI, API, and Function App, and a basic CI/CD pipeline,
**so that** I can start development and ensure code quality.

## Acceptance Criteria
*   1.1.1: Angular UI project initialized within the monorepo.
*   1.1.2: .NET Web API project initialized within the monorepo.
*   1.1.3: Azure Function App project initialized within the monorepo.
*   1.1.4: Basic CI pipeline configured to build all projects on push to the repository.
*   1.1.5: Basic CD pipeline configured to deploy a placeholder "Hello World" Azure Function App.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] 1. Initialize Monorepo Structure
  - [ ] 1.1. Initialize Angular UI project (`apps/web`) using Angular CLI (AC: 1.1.1)
  - [ ] 1.2. Initialize .NET Web API project (`apps/api`) using .NET CLI (AC: 1.1.2)
  - [ ] 1.3. Initialize Azure Function App project (`apps/processor`) using .NET CLI (AC: 1.1.3)
  - [ ] 1.4. Create `libs/shared/models` for shared TypeScript and C# models
- [ ] 2. Setup Basic CI Pipeline (AC: 1.1.4)
  - [ ] 2.1. Create `azure-pipelines.yml` at repository root
  - [ ] 2.2. Configure CI job to install Node.js (24.x LTS) and npm dependencies for Angular UI
  - [ ] 2.3. Configure CI job to build Angular UI project (`nx build web --prod`)
  - [ ] 2.4. Configure CI job to install .NET SDK (10.x LTS) and restore dependencies for .NET Web API and Azure Function App
  - [ ] 2.5. Configure CI job to publish .NET Web API project (`dotnet publish -c Release -o $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/api`)
  - [ ] 2.6. Configure CI job to publish Azure Function App project (`dotnet publish -c Release -o $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)/function`)
  - [ ] 2.7. Publish Angular UI artifact (`frontend-app`)
  - [ ] 2.8. Publish .NET Web API artifact (`backend-api`)
  - [ ] 2.9. Publish Azure Function App artifact (`backend-function`)
- [ ] 3. Setup Basic CD Pipeline for Azure Function App (AC: 1.1.5)
  - [ ] 3.1. Add a deployment stage to `azure-pipelines.yml`
  - [ ] 3.2. Configure CD job to deploy `backend-function` artifact to a placeholder Azure Function App
  - [ ] 3.3. Ensure deployment of a "Hello World" Function App is successful

## Dev Notes
### Project Structure Notes
- The file `docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md` was not found. However, other architecture documents and the PRD indicate a monorepo structure. Projects should be organized as `apps/web` (Angular UI), `apps/api` (.NET Web API), and `apps/processor` (Azure Function App). Shared models should reside in `libs/shared/models`.

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** Angular 21.1.2 (LTS), TypeScript 5.9.3, Node.js 24.13.0 (LTS), Angular CLI 21.1.2. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **Backend:** .NET Web API 10.0 (LTS), C# 14, Azure Functions (C# 14, .NET 10.0 LTS), .NET CLI 10 (LTS). [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
- **CI/CD:** Azure DevOps Pipelines. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]

### CI/CD Pipeline Configuration
- The CI/CD pipeline will be managed by Azure DevOps.
- Build commands:
    - Angular UI: `nx build web --prod` (output: `dist/apps/web`) [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]
    - .NET Web API & Azure Function App: `dotnet publish -c Release -o out` [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]
- Artifacts to be published: `frontend-app`, `backend-api`, `backend-function`. [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]
- Node.js LTS version for Angular UI build: `24.x`. [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]
- .NET LTS version for Backend builds: `10.x`. [Source: architecture/deployment-architecture.md]
- Initial CD will deploy a placeholder Azure Function App. [Source: PRD]

### Coding Standards (Relevant for Project Setup)
- **Naming Conventions:** Follow specified naming conventions for projects, folders, and files as defined in `architecture/coding-standards.md`.
- **No Hardcoded Values:** Environment-specific values (e.g., API URLs) should be stored in configuration files and accessed via strongly-typed objects. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]

### Testing Standards (Context for Initial Setup)
- The overall testing strategy follows a testing pyramid (Unit, Integration, E2E). [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md]
- Test organization will follow the structures defined in `architecture/testing-strategy.md` for frontend, backend, and E2E tests. Initial setup should prepare for these structures.
